Finished Program with the exception of a faulty Interpolation Search.
Binary Search is the default so the program can run as is.

The program is set up completely so that no changes need to be made internally.
Allows for Element and Querry Distributions of Uniform, Normal and Clumped.

Clumped Method distribution is based on a "Number of Clumps" Parameter and whether
the elements should be in evenly distributed clumps or normally distributed clumps.

*Program prompts is Array Doubling used, but I defaulted to yes in the Insert Delete Calls
as inserts will not work without Array Doubling.
