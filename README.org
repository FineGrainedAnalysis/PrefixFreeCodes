# PrefixFreeCodes
Implementation of Algorithms to Compute Optimal Prefix Free Codes (and Variants), and of programs to evaluate their relative performances.

* Objectives
  1. Algorithms to generate datasets relative to text and image compression via Optimal Prefix Free Codes
  2. Standard Algorithms of computation of optimal prefix free codes
  3. At least one new algorithm of computation of optimal prefix free codes.
  
* Prospective Calendar
