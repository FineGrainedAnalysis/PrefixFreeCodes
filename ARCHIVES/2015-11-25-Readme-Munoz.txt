The Zip folder contains the .py archives of de Deferred Data Structures implementation. It contains 4 archives:
1. MetaDDS: Kind of abstract class with not implemented methods rank and select
2. DummyDDS: Dummy Deffered Data Structures Class that extends MetaDDS and gives corrects result for rank and select, but sorts the given list
3. MyDDS: Not implemented Deferred Data Structure Class that should be the final version in a future
4. DDSTest: Unit Test for Deferred Data Structures that compares results of DummyDDS with MyDDS

The Report Archive is (for now) just the template for the final report, I've been struggling a lot with latex lately.
It's based on the thesis template given to me.
It have some text on the motivation part, thats part of my proposal translation. 
Then I decided to do my translation in other document and then add it to the final report.

The 2013 Project Summary is really informally written. So I really should look into that if I want to add it to the final report.
As an observation, 2013 project is basically a Summary of Pessoa's paper, so I could just merge it with Pesoa's summary

The translation of the first proposal is still on the way. I've been struggling a bit with the language and how to translate some sort of things
